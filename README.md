# 🌾 Forecasting Agricultural Commodity Prices using Time Series Models

[🇪🇸 Leer en español](README_ES.md)

This project aims to identify the best prediction models for monthly prices of three key agricultural commodities: **Beef**, **Corn**, and **Soybeans**.

Over 25 models were tested, including classical machine learning regressors, neural networks, statistical models, and AutoML (AutoTS). Each model was trained and validated for 12-month forecasts, then compared against real observed data.

## 📊 Dataset Information

* **Source:** World Bank Commodity Price Data (The Pink Sheet).

  * Monthly prices in nominal US dollars, available from 1960 to the present.
  * Although the full dataset spans from 1960, this project specifically used data from January 2010 to September 2024 for training and evaluation.
  * Monthly series are only available in nominal US dollars.
  * **Soybeans:** US Dollars per Metric Ton
  * **Corn:** US Dollars per Metric Ton
  * **Beef:** US Dollars per Kilogram

📦 **AutoTS Templates** The autots_templates/ folder contains the best model templates generated by AutoTS for each commodity:

    * best_model_carne.csv

    * best_model_maiz.csv

    * best_model_soja.csv

## 🏁 Key Results

Based on the best-performing models in each category, the table summarizes RMSE metrics (lower values indicate better performance):

| Commodity | Baseline Naïve | Classical ML | Neural Networks | Statistical Models | AutoTS Ensemble | 🥇 Final Winner |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | --------------- |
| Beef      | 0.90           | 0.3112       | 0.2157          | **0.1935**         | 0.49            | ✅ GLM Gaussian  |
| Corn      | 32.47          | 21.15        | 17.47           | **16.74**          | 60.24           | ✅ GLM Gaussian  |
| Soybeans  | 137.84         | 48.65        | 37.38           | **32.56**          | 166.02          | ✅ GLM Gaussian  |

🔍 **Conclusion:** The **GLM Gaussian model** was consistently the most effective, achieving the lowest RMSE across all three commodities and demonstrating more stable predictive performance compared to alternative approaches.

Forecasts were validated against real observed data from October 2024 to May 2025, confirming the robustness of the chosen model.

## 🧭 Reflection and Learnings

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience comparing classical, statistical, and neural network approaches for time series forecasting. It deepened my understanding of:

* The strengths and limitations of each modeling approach.
* Why certain models generalize and perform better in forecasting tasks.
* Implementing AutoML techniques (AutoTS) and interpreting their practical implications.

This work was developed as part of my Data Science Master's program, intended to be included in my professional portfolio.
